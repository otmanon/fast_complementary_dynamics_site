<p> 
  We propose a reduced-space elasto-dynamic solver that 
  is well suited for augmenting rigged character
   animations with secondary motion. At the core 
   of our method is a novel deformation subspace based on 
   Linear Blend Skinning that overcomes many of the shortcomings
    prior subspace methods face. Our skinning subspace is parameterized 
    entirely by a set of scalar weights, which we can obtain through 
    a small, material-aware and rig-sensitive generalized eigenvalue problem. 
    The resulting subspace can easily capture rotational motion and 
    guarantees that the resulting simulation is rotation equivariant. 
    We further propose a simple local-global solver for linear co-rotational 
    elasticity and propose a clustering method to aggregate per-tetrahedra 
    non-linear energetic quantities. The result is a compact simulation 
    that is fully decoupled from the complexity of the mesh.
